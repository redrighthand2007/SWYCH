## 📖 Project Overview

### What is it?

Swych is a **peer-to-peer campus trading app** built for college students. It lets you list items you no longer need, discover what others are selling nearby, make offers, and lock in deals — all from your phone, all within your campus community.

No middlemen. No shipping fees. Just students helping students.

### Why did you build it?
Existing campus trading happens in chaotic, fragmented WhatsApp or Telegram groups where listings get buried, negotiations are disorganized, and buyers frequently "ghost" on meetups.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

Swych is built entirely with modern Android development standards.

### Client-Side (Android)
* **Language:** Kotlin
* **UI Toolkit:** Jetpack Compose (Material 3 Design)
* **Architecture:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) + Repository Pattern
* **Image Loading:** Coil
* **Navigation:** Jetpack Navigation Compose
* **Asynchronous Logic:** Kotlin Coroutines & Flows

### Backend-as-a-Service (Supabase)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (Supabase DB)
* **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (Email/Password)
* **Storage:** Cloudinary (for fast, optimized image hosting) & Supabase Storage
* **API:** PostgREST via Supabase Kotlin Client

### System Architecture
### Architecture Overview (MVVM + Clean Architecture)
* **UI Layer:** Jetpack Compose, ViewModels, StateFlow.
* **Domain Layer:** Use Cases (PostItemUseCase, AcceptOfferUseCase).
* **Data Layer:** SupabaseNetworkDataSource, DealRepository, ItemRepository.

### Database Schema (Supabase)
* **`users` table:** `uid`, `name`, `block`, `phone`, `email`.
* **`items` table:** `id`, `seller_id`, `title`, `description`, `price`, `category`, `status`, `photo_url`.
* **`deals` table:** `id`, `item_id`, `buyer_id`, `seller_id`, `status` (PENDING, SOLD, REJECTED).
*(Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled for all tables to protect user data).*

### Deal Flow Logic (First-Come-First-Serve)
When a buyer submits an offer, the item and deal status are instantly locked to **PENDING**. The seller can then either **Accept** (marks as SOLD and hides from feed) or **Reject** (returns item to OPEN).
